<strong>Read External Storage</strong> <p>
    GCA Launcher requires access to your devices external memory for an assortment of reasons.
    The Wallpaper API will require permission due to the colors being processed by the bitmap it extracts
    and processed on your device memory using cache. The conversion process cannot take place unless it has
    a home for the file being processed.
</p> <p>
    GCA Launcher will also store user files and launcher database cache files on your device to help
    process actions and read data faster. Files include user data cache, saved shared preferences, crash logs.
